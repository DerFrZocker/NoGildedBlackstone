# NoGildedBlackstone

NoGildedBlackstone is a small Spigot plugin, with which you can remove the gilded blackstone block from structures.
It thereby only affects new generated chunks and only gilded blackstone which generated from structures
(which is the only way gilded blackstone generated in vanilla).
The plugin gives you the option to select which structures should be checked (Can be vanilla or data pack structures)
and with a deny-list / allow-list also which worlds it should affect.
